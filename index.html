            </h2>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
                I love to cook, but I haven’t always. In fact, for most of my early adult life, cooking dinner usually
                meant microwaving a frozen dinner or adding boiling water to something that came from a box. It wasn’t
                until I got married that I started eating real food because I married a guy who cooks. I started joining
                him in the kitchen and realized that cooking could be fun. Eating real food was really fun. And gaining
                confidence as a home chef? That was life changing!
